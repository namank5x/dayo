<h2 id="html-hbs-file-structure">2. HTML / hbs file structure</h2>
<p>The theme uses google's material design lite library <a href="http://getmdl.io">Material Design Lite</a></p>
<p>First let me explain what each and every file is doing in the theme. I will then guide you through some basic configuration that you must do on every page to make the theme suit your needs</p>
<p><strong>default.hbs</strong> : This the skeleton of the theme. The parts of the theme that are present on every page are included here like the top navigation menu or the navigation drawer that pops out in mobile devices.</p>
<p><strong>index.hbs</strong> : This is the main posts page where all your posts are seen you can edit how each and every element looks here</p>
<p><strong>page.hbs</strong> : This is the default layout for every static page that you make in ghost. you can customize things here like if you want to remove the header add commenting or remove commenting.</p>
<p><strong>page-features.hbs</strong> : This contains the code to modify any individual page. so if you have static page called features you can make a new file called page-{your-page-name} and then that particular page can have its own unique styling</p>
<p><strong>post.hbs</strong> : This page contains how an individual post looks likes. Here you can edit things like what your posts should contain. eg: you want the tags to display at the end of each post or not etc.</p>
<p><strong>header.hbs</strong> : This is the header part of your theme where your blog title is displayed along with the blog description and an email form. Here you can accept upto 1000 emails per month using the formspree services <a href="http://formspree.io">fromspree.io</a> which I will explain how to configure.</p>
<h3 id="default.hbs">Default.hbs</h3>
<p>Here you would want to change a few things</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The title of your blog in the navigation menu. This title is commented out as &quot;Title&quot; the default.hbs file so you can change it to the name of your blog.</p></li>
<li><p>The navigation items. These are commented out as &quot;Navigation&quot;. you can change the options in the navigation menu.</p>
<p>Please make sure to change the navigation menu options in both the desktop and mobile versions they are commented out respectively.</p></li>
<li><p>The footer text. You can change the footer text to suit your needs. Its is very evident once you open the default.hbs file.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="index.hbs">index.hbs</h3>
<p>Here you might want to change a few things as well</p>
<ul>
<li>The main header. You can comment out the header if you don't want it to display on your home page like this .</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Change the second line of the file from</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>{{&gt; header}} --------&gt; {{!&gt; header}}</code></pre>
<p>adding an exclamation in front just comments out the header and hence won't be seen on your blog. You can do the same on every page.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The tags. If you don't want the tags to show after every post . you can comment the part between {{#if tags}} and {{/if}}</p>
<p>similarly you can comment out whatever part you don't want in your blog</p></li>
<li><p>The social icons.. I have provided support for 8 sociall icons however if you want to add more or different you can always reach out to me I will get back to you asap.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>here you can comment out the social icons you don't want and let the ones you want remain this page is also heavily commented to help you understand what each and every social icon is doing.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The categories. There is a categories box under the social icon box. You can change the categories here It is recommended that these categories be the tags that you may create in your ghost blog.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>so to add a catagory you can do the following in the index.hbs file eg:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;{{@blog.url}}/tag/{{your-tag-name}}&quot;class=&quot;catlist&quot;&gt; {{your-tag-name}} &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;</code></pre>
<p>you can add the following line to add as many tags as you want to your theme.</p>
<p>5 . The Box four contains random text. you can add whatever you want to write over here. you can even comment out the whole box if you want to remove this box from your own theme. &gt;</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER CHANGES YOU MAKE, YOU MAKE IT ON BOTH THE WEB AND MOBILE VERSION ... THE MOBILE VERSION IS RIGHT BELOW THE WEB VERSION UNDER &quot;small screen layout&quot;</strong></p>
<h3 id="page.hbs">page.hbs</h3>

<ul>
<li>Static page with header</li>

<li>Static page no sidebar and comments</li>
<li>Static page with side bar no comments</li>
<li>Static page no sidebar no comments</li>
